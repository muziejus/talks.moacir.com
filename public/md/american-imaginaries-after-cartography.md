“Under-Mapped Spaces”<br />
David Rumsey Map Center, March 2022
</small>

Note: Thanks all for coming to this virtual talk, and thank you to Chloe,
Kelsey, and Riley for inviting me in the first place. Thanks also to Tyler and
the rest of the David Rumsey Map Center staff for making this talk possible.
Thanks also to The David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Geospatial Center, the
Branner Earth Sciences Library have generously offered to support this workshop
with their facilities, cartographic resources, and a grant of $5,000. We have
further secured a $10,000 grant from the McCoy Family Center. The Stanford
Department of History has committed $3,000, which Stanford’s Provost has
generously matched. We are at present pursuing additional small grants from the
Center for Comparative Studies for Race and Ethnicity and various area studies
clusters at Stanford. 

My email and Twitter are here on the first slide, and they will be on the last slide. I don't often share my thoughts with a large audience like this, abut because what I will present is a work in progress, I leave the contact info as a mode by which the conversation can continue. 

Anyway, it's a shame we haven't been able to meet in person, but hopefully my talk and those of my colleagues will reach wider audiences instead.

Finally, I bring you all greetings from lands that have welcomed many peoples
to their shores, including, among others, the Lenape.

Note: Bringing up the Lenape makes some sense because the title of this talk, "if England crie out, this Norumbega offreth the Remedie," refers to a place whose name may have roots in an Algonkian language related to the Alkgonkian languages spoken by the Lenape. I'll have more to say about Norumbega as this talk opens up, but for now, suffice it to say that Norumbega is a mystery.

Here it is, styled as Tierra de Nurumberg, in a 1548 map that happens to be in the David Rumsey collection.

If I succeed with this talk, it will accomplish many things, but the central goal at this second is to build on a project I've been working on for a few years now. That is, I'm very interested in the stories of people who come to America, specifically the United States. These are definitionally stories of settlers who then live on stolen land, but these same settlers are often refugees, "tempest-tossed," in Emma Lazarus's well known words. 

Their stories grab me because they rely on a sense of space that bends and reshapes over the course of their migration and afterward. That is, before their journey, there is an "America" that exists as a geographic and political fact, but there is also the America that exists in their minds as a space that fills in with their American experience. 

Importantly, however, in giving the American image detail, the image of the place they left behind—for whatever reason—also changes. In short, how do people talk about America before they've migrated there, and how do they talk about the place they left behind once they're in America? And then what if they leave America and return back to that place?

These two places, America and origin, remain unstable. They are produced and reproduced as the people speak or think or dream. And even as they act, especially with the act of return. 

In the longer version of this talk, then, I consult an archive of novel-like objects (that are mostly just novels), and examine the mutability of their various spatialities, especially along the axis of America and not-America. How, then, can I describe these spatialities? How can I analyze them? Can I map them? What would those maps look like? 

I also look to and reason about the question of when or if these settlers and or refugees become AmericanS. And once they are Americans, do they ever stop being so?

The answers to these questions are preliminary at best, at least without a lot of other work to lead us (or me) to that point, which is why these questions lie in the background of tonight's talk, while I will instead focus on the questions of how to think about what these people say, not about what they say per se.

The title of this talk closes a text printed in 1584, seemingly with an audience of one: Queen Elizabeth. The text's author never crossed the Atlantic, and the text's reader never did, either. But the text nevertheless bursts with an imagined place, Norumbega, a part of America, full of promise and exactly what would be the remedy for ailing England, if only England would ask for help.

## Thevet & Hakluyt


Note: The author of the 1584 text, _A Discourse Concerning Western Planting_, is on the right side of this picture, reading a book. That's Richard Hakluyt, a star of tonight's talk. He's in Paris here, around the same time that he is writing the Discourse, in the study of the fellow on the left of the image, André Thevet, who at the time was a court cosmographer and serial plagiariser. Unlike Hakluyt, he did cross the Atlantic, spending a few months as a chaplain in short-lived French settlement in what is now Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. 

Thevet had a knack for collecting accounts of others, compiling them, and publishing them as a narrative of his own travels. In the process of doing so, he acquired lots of information about the Americas as well as the levant. Hakluyt, sent to Paris to serve in the British embassy as a collector of information concerning these new lands, would have been right at home in Thevet's study, eager to devour all the information therein.


Giovanni da Verrazzano, whose name is affixed to a bridge fewer than 20 miles away from me, apparently found a place named Norumbega, though he never used the word himself, during his visit to this continent in 1524. Instead, it appears for the first time in a map drawn by his brother a few years later. These wheels in motion, the myth of Norumbega grew, a

1584 Plantings... comprehensive statement of English colonization.
