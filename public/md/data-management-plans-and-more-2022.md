thing’s first, I want you all to open up this presentation on your computers.
It will make things much, much easier. Head on over to

## Research Data?!?

> the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.

## “Recorded Factual Material” <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Data are never recorded. They are captured. Taken.
* Data serve interests, including your own.
* Data are never “raw” but always “cooked.” 
* Data about people are simplified representations, not replacements.

## Projects Are Processes

* Things change <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Handling and anticipating change is management <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Research often involves data <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Hence, data management <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## The Research Data Lifecycle

## (Why) Is This Funny?

<blockquote>
<p>I will store all data on at least one, and possibly up to 50, hard drives
in my lab. The directory structure will be custom, not self-explanatory, and
in no way documented or described. Students working with the data will be
encouraged to make their own copies and modify them as they please, in order
to ensure that no one can ever figure out what the actual real raw data
is.</p>

Backups will rarely, if ever, be done.

## Managed Data Lasts

* Helps with reproducibility and replicability
* Can follow FAIR (Findable, Acceesible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles
* Assists future you with understanding what you were doing

---

## Managed Data Are the Rules

* 2011: NSF, NOAA, and NEH require DMPs
* 2012: NIH joins (new policy [as of 2020](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2020-23674/final-policy-for-data-management-and-sharing-and-supplemental-information)!)
* 2014: DOE
* 2015: NASA

## A DMP Answers:

* What types of data will we be capturing or creating? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* What formats will we use to save our data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How will we describe the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Who has access to and how do they access the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How FAIR is the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Who manages the data’s integrity? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## And a Few Free Answers:

* Document everything and build codebooks
* Establish a consistent file naming and organizing scheme
* Provide for automated backups
* Plan ahead for analysis, sharing, publishing, and archiving

---

## Writing a DMP

* Consult with
  [RDS](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html)
* Read Columbia-provided [DMPs](https://research.columbia.edu/writing-data-management-plan)
* Use the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/)!

## 🎉 You Got the Grant 😎  Now What?

---

![LabArchives](https://i.imgur.com/66j8vxc.png)<!-- .element: class="w-1/2 mx-auto"-->

* Electronic lab notebook
* Free for Columbia users
* Secure even for HIPAA
* Can help manage entire project / lab

---

![Git](https://i.imgur.com/r7Bd7VP.png) <!-- .element: class="w-1/2 mx-auto"-->

* Version control software
* Completely free
* Can be extended for use in data & project management

---

## More than Management

Consult with RDS for help with analysis and visualization, specifically but
not limited to:

* [R](http://r-project.org) and [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org)
* Python and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* JavaScript and [D3](http://d3js.org)
* GIS and other geospatial analysis

---

## And Then Share

Consult with [Digital
Scholarship](https://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship.html)
about publishing, sharing, depositing, and archiving your data pursuant to
your data management needs such as:

* [Academic Commons](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/) for publications
  and datasets
* [Dryad](http://datadryad.org) for curated datasets

## How Do We Improve This? <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->
